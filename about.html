    <p>Entering the University of Florida as a freshman, all I really knew was that I loved to write. I decided to major in journalism for this reason alone, and I wasn't quite sure where that choice would take me. Along with writing, I loved photography, traveling and (especially) fashion -- all interests that weren't exactly atypical for an 18-year-old girl just starting college. I knew I had to find my niché to succeed in journalism, but I had absolutely no idea what that was. My freshman year was full of dining hall trips, <i> many </i> a late nigh with my dormmates, and gen ed classes that I, <i> well</i>...wasn't a huge fan of. I wanted to find a specific direction to go in, but how? </p>
        <p>After a few internships within my various areas of interest (and beyond), I eventually ended up interning with a wonderful website called <a href="http://www.collegefashionista.com/">College Fashionista</a>. That was almost three years ago. And, as the say, the rest is history. Beginning with writing for <a href="http://www.collegefashionista.com/">College Fashionista</a>, I slowly, but surely started to realize that fashion journalism was what I was truly passionate about. I loved taking street style photographs of other students' stylish outfits</p>
        <p>I officially started writing for <a href="http://www.collegefashionista.com/">College Fashionista</a> while I studied abroad in The Netherlands. Yup, I was that crazy girl who decided to leave college her sophomore year and study abroad in a country I barely knew anything about for 10 long months. I spent two semesters on exchange at University College Utrecht, and the experience changed me forever. I had always been interested in travel and fashion, but being able to combine the two things while I interned for CollegeFashionista sparked a passion in me that hasn't left since. I can truly say that now I am entirely sure where I want to be headed in the future. International fashion journalism may sound specific, but it is what I love. And what is more important than that? </p>
            <p> Now I write for a variety of fashion publications (including <a href="http://www.wanderlust-and-such.blogspot.com/"> my own personal style blog </a>), travel whenever I get the chance and am persuing a career at a fashion-oriented publication in a position which reflects my skills and interests. </p>
